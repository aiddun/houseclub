Virtual 'town' for online events with positional audio. Features a small engine built with web canvas + websockets/socket.io, custom real-time biaural positional audio filters w/ WebAudio, and online voice using Agora. Tried to use as few dependencies as possible. 

Audio requires Agora keys in game.js and .env

Server requires: node, socket.io and express

To run: `node server.js` and navigate to 0.0.0.0:8081
